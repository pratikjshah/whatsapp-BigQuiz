12/30/19, 4:57 PM - Nambirajan Vanamamalai: Which brand's logo had colours because they are also the colours of Spain flag, where many early Californian settlers were born? Perhaps by displaying Spanish colours it was hoped an emotional bond would be created.
12/30/19, 4:58 PM - Pratik Shah: Let's play around with all possible types of questions and chat scenarios
12/30/19, 4:58 PM - Nambirajan Vanamamalai: Two major
12/30/19, 4:58 PM - Nambirajan Vanamamalai: One is Image which is the primary
12/30/19, 4:59 PM - Nambirajan Vanamamalai: Other is text
12/30/19, 4:59 PM - Nambirajan Vanamamalai: And if you refer to my design
12/30/19, 4:59 PM - Nambirajan Vanamamalai: If we can highlight the question chat alone
12/30/19, 4:59 PM - Nambirajan Vanamamalai: So readers can skip to the questions they are interested about
12/30/19, 5:02 PM - Pratik Shah: To identify question is also tricky.. I can't rely on just question mark
12/30/19, 5:02 PM - Pratik Shah: Or WH words
12/30/19, 5:02 PM - Pratik Shah: As they are very frequent
12/30/19, 5:05 PM - Nambirajan Vanamamalai: #endquiz

12/30/19, 5:06 PM - Nambirajan Vanamamalai: Can we have a back end panel where I can tag questions?
12/30/19, 5:07 PM - Pratik Shah: That will be too much effort.. plus if WhatsApp chat format changes.  I will have to code everything again
12/30/19, 5:07 PM - Nambirajan Vanamamalai: Got it
12/30/19, 5:08 PM - Pratik Shah: Let me collect on keywords.. like..

WH and identify and question mark
12/30/19, 5:08 PM - Pratik Shah: More than 2 and I will mark as questionüòõ
12/30/19, 5:08 PM - Nambirajan Vanamamalai: Yup that's a good logic
12/30/19, 5:08 PM - Nambirajan Vanamamalai: Guess that logic will break very rarely
12/30/19, 5:09 PM - Pratik Shah: We can keep evolving the logic as it's independent
12/30/19, 5:09 PM - Nambirajan Vanamamalai: üëçüèª
12/30/19, 5:09 PM - Nambirajan Vanamamalai: Do we have to refresh the chat backup everyday?
12/30/19, 5:10 PM - Pratik Shah: Yup..
12/30/19, 5:10 PM - Pratik Shah: But I am trying to think of a better way
12/30/19, 5:10 PM - Nambirajan Vanamamalai: Ok
12/30/19, 5:10 PM - Pratik Shah: For now it will be daily upload
12/30/19, 5:10 PM - Nambirajan Vanamamalai: Ok that's fine; I can refresh it
12/30/19, 5:10 PM - Nambirajan Vanamamalai: Daily/ regular interval
12/30/19, 5:11 PM - Pratik Shah: Yeah
12/30/19, 5:11 PM - Nambirajan Vanamamalai: If you checked my design I gave provision for Google ads
12/30/19, 5:12 PM - Nambirajan Vanamamalai: We can keep some space as placeholder for it in every page?
12/30/19, 5:13 PM - Pratik Shah: Yes that can be added.  All layout changes we will do once it's stable
12/30/19, 5:13 PM - Nambirajan Vanamamalai: üëçüèª
12/30/19, 5:13 PM - Pratik Shah: Share that image here again
12/30/19, 5:13 PM - Pratik Shah: Let's see if it has some logic
